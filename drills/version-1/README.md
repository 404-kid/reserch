 You're on a roll- steamrolling through a new project at record speed. You're flyin' high, and then it happens. You hit a wall. Maybe you're using a new tool, can't quite wrap your head around a problem, or maybe you're working in a new language altogether. Even the most seasoned developers encounter problems they've never seen before. Being able to research those issues quickly and effectively is what separates the best from the rest.

 In this assessment you'll be researching the following problem:

 You're writing in Swift, and want to output "Hi! I'm 30 years old". Why doesn't the following code do that?

 // Begin Code Snippet

 var age = 30

 print('Hi! I'm' + age + 'years old')

 //End Code Snippet

 Walk us through the steps you'd take to better understand it. You'll need to:

 - Consult at least two resources
 - Reflect on how you found them (if you used google, what did you search?)
 - Explain why you chose to use each
 - Determine whether each resource was helpful
 - Reflect on why it was (or wasn't) helpful

 Add those reflections to reflection.md
