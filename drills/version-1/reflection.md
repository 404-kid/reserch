### Resources Used
-https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24646794/concatenate-number-with-string-in-swift

-https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Zf79Ns8_oY

### How I found these
-Googled "swift concatenating a number in a string"

-Youtube searched "swift concatenating a number in a string"

### Why I chose each resource
-they were one of the first results in the search results

-they had a lot of views which usually indicates higher quality

### Were the resources helpful?
-the first resource is a stack overflow answer that answers the question immediately so this the most helpful one

-the second resource no doubt has the answer but its buried in a hour long video that I don't need to go through

### Why were they (or weren't they)?
-the first resource simply says that you need to convert the number to a string while you're concatenating it with String(myVariable) or \(myVariable)

-the second one is a useful introduction into swift but was too much information to go through because lazy, kinda makes me wonder if you could make a search function that searches the subtitles so you could find a specific point in a video
