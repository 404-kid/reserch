You're on a roll- steamrolling through a new project at record speed. You're flyin' high, and then it happens. You hit a wall. Maybe you're using a new tool, can't quite wrap your head around a problem, or maybe you're working in a new language altogether. Even the most seasoned developers encounter problems they've never seen before. Being able to research those issues quickly and effectively is what separates the best from the rest.

In this assessment you'll be researching a common technical issue. Walk us through the steps you'd take to better understand it. You'll need to:

- Consult at least two resources
- Reflect on how you found them (if you used google, what did you search?)
- Explain why you chose to use each
- Determine whether each resource was helpful
- Reflect on why it was (or wasn't) helpful

Add those reflections to reflection.md
