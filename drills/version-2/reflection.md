### How I found these
-Google (relational database, non-relational database)
-

### Why I chose each resource
-They seemed to have understandable terms and only enough adds to remind me that life is a waking consumerist nightmare.
-

### Were the resources helpful?
-Hopefully
-

### Why were they (or weren't they)?
-So it seems that a relational db has tables to organize its data but a non-relational db does not instead relying on collections of JSON data, if thats wrong then I guess they were bad.
